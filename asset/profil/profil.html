        <h1>ABOUT</h1> 
        My name is M. Syakirin. Iâ€™m a software engineer & freelance web developer in Pekalongan -- with roots in digital marketing & SEO. I'm passionate about game, technology and basically everything that makes the internet tick. <br> <br>
        My work currently consists of a full time engineering role at The Noun Project & managing ongoing freelance clients and side projects. I find this balancing act to be super resourceful in terms my learning as a web developer, as well as for keeping up with the rapid expansion of developer tools, libraries, frameworks, etc. <br><br>
        In 2020, I started at MIT to broaden my knowledge of the programing ecosystem. Since then, I fell in love with & have been primarily using React & Redux in web applications. For static sites, <br><br>
        I love using codeigniter & laravel for dinamic sites. Gatsby for creating blazing fast, SEO-driven headless frontend user interfaces. Whether you're a business owner looking to get started on a app or web development project with a freelance web developer, a developer looking to collaborate on something cool, or just wanting to say hi, shoot me a message and let's work together.
